# Multi-threaded Proxy Server and Client (C++)

## Overview

This project is a **multi-threaded proxy server** written in **C++**. The proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client and the web server, forwarding requests and responses. The project includes two versions of the proxy server:
1. **Proxy server with cache**: Stores and reuses responses to speed up future requests.
2. **Proxy server without cache**: Always fetches fresh data from the origin server.

### Key Features:
- **HTTP Request Parsing**: The proxy parses incoming HTTP requests using a custom parser.
- **Multi-threading**: Handles multiple client requests concurrently using separate threads.
- **Caching**: Optionally caches responses to improve performance for repeated requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++` for Linux/Mac, or MSVC for Windows)
- `Make` (for building the project)
- If on Windows, a suitable IDE or command-line toolchain that supports C++11 or higher.

### Building the Project

1. Open a terminal (or command prompt).
2. Navigate to the project directory where the `Makefile` is located.
3. Run the following command to build the project:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

### Running the Proxy Server

Once the project is built, you can run either the **cached** or **uncached** proxy server.

#### Running the Proxy Server (Without Cache)

```bash
./proxy_server_without_cache
````

#### Running the Proxy Server (With Cache)

```bash
./proxy_server_with_cache
```

### Testing the Proxy

To test the proxy, you can configure your browser or use a tool like **curl** or **Postman** to make HTTP requests through the proxy.

Example using **curl**:

```bash
curl --proxy http://localhost:8080 http://example.com
```

This will send a request to the `example.com` website through the proxy running on `localhost` at port `8080`.

## How It Works

1. **Client sends HTTP request**: The client (browser, curl, etc.) sends an HTTP request to the proxy server.
2. **Proxy parses the request**: The proxy parses the request using the `ParsedRequest` class, which breaks the raw HTTP string into method, URI, headers, and version.
3. **Caching (Optional)**: The proxy checks if the requested page is already cached. If so, it serves it from the cache.
4. **Proxy forwards the request**: If not cached, the proxy forwards the request to the destination server (e.g., example.com).
5. **Proxy sends response**: The server's response is received and sent back to the client. If caching is enabled, the response is saved for future requests.
6. **Multi-threading**: The server can handle multiple clients at once by using separate threads for each request, allowing concurrent connections.

## Components

### 1. **HTTP Request Parsing (`proxy_parse.cpp` and `proxy_parse.hpp`)**

* **`ParsedRequest`**: Represents the full HTTP request, including method, URI, version, and headers.
* **`parse()`**: A static function that parses the raw HTTP request string into a `ParsedRequest` object.
* **`unparse()`**: Rebuilds the HTTP request from the `ParsedRequest` object back into raw string format.

### 2. **Proxy Server Core**

* **With Cache**: Stores previously fetched responses for reuse, speeding up future requests.
* **Without Cache**: Always fetches fresh responses from the web server.

### 3. **Multi-threading**

* Each client connection is handled in a separate thread, allowing multiple clients to interact with the proxy server at the same time without blocking each other.

---

## Future Improvements

* **Support for HTTPS**: Implement SSL/TLS encryption to support secure HTTPS traffic.
* **Advanced Caching**: Implement a more sophisticated cache eviction algorithm (e.g., LRU).
* **Persistent Connections**: Support HTTP/1.1 persistent connections (keep-alive).
* **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and response codes for invalid requests.
